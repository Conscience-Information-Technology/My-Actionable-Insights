# Git Workflow & Common Commands

#### The GitHub flow for My Application Insights

The Git flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow built around core Git commands. The GitHub flow has six steps, each with distinct benefits when implemented:

1. **Clone Branch:** Clone latest DEV branch from centralised repository at your local storage i.e. proffered file location.

    Git Bash :  `git clone` [`https://ConscienceIT@dev.azure.com/ConscienceIT/MAI/_git/MAI`](https://ConscienceIT@dev.azure.com/ConscienceIT/MAI/_git/MAI)\`\`

2. **Create a branch:** Topic branches created from the canonical deployment branch \(usually `master`\) allow teams to contribute to many parallel efforts. Short-lived topic branches, in particular, keep teams focused and results in quick ships.
3. **Add commits:** Snapshots of development efforts within a branch create safe, revertible points in the project’s history.
4. **Open a pull request:** Pull requests publish a project’s ongoing efforts and set the tone for a transparent development process.
5. **Discuss and review code:** Teams participate in code reviews by commenting, testing, and reviewing open pull requests. Code review is at the core of an open and participatory culture.
6. **Merge:** Upon clicking merge, GitHub automatically performs the equivalent of a local ‘git merge’ operation. GitHub also keeps the entire branch development history on the merged pull request.
7. **Deploy:** Teams can choose the best release cycles or incorporate continuous integration tools and operate with the assurance that code on the deployment branch has gone through a robust workflow.
